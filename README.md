# About
This repo is a personal blog project with a dashboard and functionality to create, edit, archive and publish posts.
Typical project, I know. However, good to learn the things I did wrong the first time as this project is a remake of an old blog project.

Check out the blog: https://blog.shobhitnagpal.com/

Some new things I tried:
- Skeletons
- Tailwind
- Lottie animations
- Vercel deployment

Note: Updated code for both frontend and backend are present on individual repos to host them on Vercel.
Backend: https://github.com/Shobhit-Nagpal/blogv2-backend
Frontend: https://github.com/Shobhit-Nagpal/blogv2-frontend

# Tech stack
